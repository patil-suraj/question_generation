The gastrointestinal tract has many neurological atoms and endocrine cells, and if you are more sensitive to nerves and endocrines, it reacts to mild stimulation in the environment, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction. As a result, gastrointestinal disorders are closely related to mental state, mental state, eating habits and sleep. Recommendations: Treatment for oral treatment of intestinal tracts (no antibiotics during the use of intestinal receptor group drugs) and treatment of osmosis such as an ammonium PIRE (Despite) to relieve intestinal cramps. This disease is recommended for improvement mainly through dietary and lifestyle adjustments:Regular and controlled diets are regularly quantified and chewed down to facilitate intestinal digestion and avoid bulimia; 2. To avoid irritant diets that are as intolerant or allergic as possible to foods that are suspiciously intolerant or allergic, such as shrimps, crabs, etc., and to prohibit hot, frozen, cold food, night snacks and tobacco and coffee;High-fat diets are easy to eat, easy to digest and less greasy. High-fat diets can cause digestive abnormalities and therefore limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat, and minimize the consumption of fried foods, chocolate, ice cream, cream, etc. Two weeks to see the effect, two to four weeks to be effective, and then to stop the medication when the symptoms are generally better; if the effect is not good, then a timely gastrointestinal lens, with a clear diagnosis of the abdominal ultrasound, will be followed by targeted treatment. The specific drugs used are:(a) Pelican capsules, 1 round 2 rounds, 3 times a day;Descent (civil ammonium) tablets, one plate, three times a day, taken during meal. I hope my answer will help you! Happy health! No colonoscopy for now!

To avoid irritant diets that are as intolerant or allergic as possible to foods that are suspiciously intolerant or allergic, such as shrimps, crabs, etc., and to prohibit hot, frozen, cold food, night snacks and tobacco and coffee;High-fat diets are easy to eat, easy to digest and less greasy. High-fat diets can cause digestive abnormalities and therefore limit the intake of fat, especially animal fat, and minimize the consumption of fried foods, chocolate, ice cream, cream, etc. Two weeks to see the effect, two to four weeks to be effective, and then to stop the medication when the symptoms are generally better; if the effect is not good, then a timely gastrointestinal lens, with a clear diagnosis of the abdominal ultrasound, will be followed by targeted treatment.
